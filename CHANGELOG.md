- refactor[project] moving project files around
- release: prepare version bump with multiple changes
- chore(project): Scaffolding modular project structure, and migrating legacy prototype and leaving room for a more structured program.
- chore(meta): snapshot to record the state of the monolith before proceeding to refactoring and proper versioning control
- added textures
- 3D textures tested with a cobblestone cube
- Its TEA TIME! replaced boring cubes and pyramids as test objects with a teapot.  Also refactored the rendering.py file to make it more pythonic and less repitive
- replaced hardcoded object meshes to an import-object-file function
- NOW IN 3D!
- fps-style mouse control of view
- WASD movement
- refactored: functional to POOP
- drawing from two separate vertex array objects in each from: squares and triangles
- rendering quads
- added instanced rendering.
- From Scratch: Implementing OpenGL. Hello Triangle!

- switched from pygame to pyglet and implemented shaders to perform vertex and fragment calculations.
- fixing local git
- git was corrupted.  New local git
- optimized matrix operations
- First working 3d Rendering Pipeline execution using basic meshed squares.
- First commit. bare bones renderer with keyboard camera controls. Can hardcode RH Axis and triangles of various colours.
- Initial commit
